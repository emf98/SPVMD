Welcome!

This folder is for code associated with the varied calculation of ellipse geometries for application to analyses. 
Code from this folder supports a manuscript by Attard, Fernandez, and Lang 2024. 

Below are descriptions of the contents of this folder:
-> 'EllipseDef.py' contains definition statement code supporting the actual ellipse-based calculations for ERA-5 and ERA-I datasets.
This code can be used at most pressure levels and can contour other features of interest through gph beyond the stratospheric polar vortex.
Please check this code to update the locations of your saved data files. Additionally, please uncomment save fig lines if you desire to make polar-centric ellipse figures. This part of the code may return issues when attempting to look at other areas globally if you do not modify the cartopy distinctions. 
-> `fitEllipse3_new.py` contains additional mathematical definition statement code supporting running the main ellipse code.
